    "text": "TheoryPracticeSummary\n\n\n\n\n1. Why psychologists need descriptive statistics\nImagine you run your very first study:\n120 students fill in an anxiety questionnaire before an important exam.\nYou download the data, open the file – and suddenly you are staring at a long list of numbers.\nOn its own, this list does not tell you much. You cannot immediately see\n\nhow anxious the average student feels,\n\nwhether there are big differences between students,\n\nwhether anxiety is mostly low with a few very anxious students,\n\nor whether students in a “high-stress” group are actually more anxious.\n\nDescriptive statistics are the tools that turn this raw list of numbers into a clear picture. They help you summarise, organise, and describe the data so you can understand what is going on in your sample.\nBefore we talk about hypotheses, p-values, or effect sizes, we always start here: with a careful descriptive look at the data. If the descriptive picture is wrong or unclear, all later conclusions become shaky.\nYou can think of descriptive statistics as the “language” your data speaks. Learning this language is one of the core skills of a psychologist who works with empirical findings.\n\n\n\n2. From individual cases to an overview\nPsychological data almost always come from many individuals:\nstudents, patients, couples, families, therapy groups.\nFor example:\n\n120 students’ anxiety scores (0–40)\n\n80 patients’ depression scores before and after therapy\n\n200 people’s hours of sleep per night\n\n60 participants’ reaction times in a decision task\n\nLooking at each person one by one is impossible. Instead, we ask questions at the group level:\n\nWhat is a typical anxiety score in this group?\n\nHow much do scores vary between people?\n\nAre extreme values present – e.g., extremely high depression scores?\n\nHow does one group (e.g., low vs. high stress) compare to another?\n\nDescriptive statistics provide answers by compressing many numbers into a few meaningful summaries.\n\n\n\n3. Variables and levels of measurement\nBefore summarising anything, we must understand what kind of variable we are dealing with. Different variables allow different kinds of questions and statistics.\n\nNominal variables – categories without order\nNominal variables place people into categories with no natural ranking.\nExamples in psychology:\n\nhandedness: left / right\n\ntherapy type: CBT / ACT / psychodynamic / none\n\nfavourite social media platform\n\nFor nominal variables we can meaningfully talk about:\n\nhow many people are in each category\n\nwhich category is most common\n\nWe cannot meaningfully compute a mean or a median of “therapy types”.\n\n\nOrdinal variables – ordered categories\nOrdinal variables have categories that can be ordered, but we do not know how big the steps between categories are.\nExamples:\n\nsymptom severity: “none, mild, moderate, severe”\n\nagreement with a statement: 1 = “strongly disagree” to 5 = “strongly agree”\n\nsatisfaction with therapy: “not at all” to “very much”\n\nHere we can say:\n\nA score of 4 means more of something than a score of 2.\n\nBut we do not know if the difference between 1 and 2 is the same size as the difference between 4 and 5.\n\nFor ordinal data, medians and percentiles are often more appropriate than means, because they respect the order without assuming equal distances.\n\n\nInterval variables – equal steps, no true zero\nInterval variables have equal units, but zero does not mean “nothing”.\nThe classic example is temperature in °C:\nThe difference between 10°C and 20°C is the same as between 20°C and 30°C, but 0°C does not mean “no temperature”.\nIn psychology we rarely have pure interval variables, but many scales are treated as if they were at least approximately interval. This is one reason why we often compute means and standard deviations for questionnaire scores.\n\n\nRatio variables – equal steps and a meaningful zero\nFor ratio variables, zero truly means “none of the quantity”.\nExamples:\n\nreaction time in milliseconds (0 ms = no time)\n\nnumber of mistakes in a memory test (0 errors = perfect performance)\n\nhours of sleep per night (0 hours = did not sleep)\n\nanxiety scores from 0 to 40, where 0 means no reported anxiety symptoms\n\nMost continuous psychological variables are at least approximately ratio. For ratio variables we can use all the familiar tools: means, SDs, ratios (“twice as fast”), correlations, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n4. Describing distributions: not just one number\nEach variable in your dataset has a distribution: it shows how often different values occur.\nFor example, if you plot the frequency of anxiety scores from 0 to 40, you might see:\n\nmany students around 18–22 points,\n\nfewer students with very low or very high anxiety,\n\nperhaps a single very anxious student around 35.\n\nThis shape matters. Two variables can have the same mean but very different distributions. Knowing the distribution helps you decide:\n\nwhich summary statistics are appropriate,\n\nwhether the data meet assumptions for later methods,\n\nwhether a few extreme values are driving the results.\n\nIn descriptive statistics, we often describe distributions in words:\n\n“Anxiety scores were roughly symmetric and centred around 20, with most students scoring between 15 and 25. Only a few students reported very low or very high anxiety.”\n\nBeing able to write such sentences clearly is a core skill for psychological reporting.\n\n\n\n5. Central tendency: describing the “typical” value\nWe now turn to measures of central tendency — numbers that describe where the centre of a distribution lies.\n\nMean – the arithmetic average\nThe mean is what many people call the “average”:\nadd all scores and divide by the number of scores.\nIn our anxiety example, a mean of 20 would mean that, on average, students reported moderate anxiety.\nStrengths:\n\nuses all information in the data\n\nwidely used in research articles and statistics\n\nWeakness:\n\nvery sensitive to outliers.\nIf one student has a score of 40, the mean moves upwards, even if everyone else has moderate anxiety.\n\nBecause of this sensitivity, the mean works best for distributions that are not extremely skewed and do not contain extreme outliers.\n\n\nMedian – the middle observation\nThe median is the value that splits the distribution in half:\n50% of scores are below, 50% are above.\nIf the median anxiety score is 19, half of the students have anxiety 19 or lower, and half have 19 or higher.\nStrengths:\n\nrobust to extreme values (one very anxious student does not change the median much)\n\nworks well for skewed or ordinal data\n\nWeakness:\n\nless sensitive to subtle changes in the whole distribution\n\n\n\nMode – the most frequent value\nThe mode is the value that occurs most often.\nThis is especially useful for categorical variables:\n\n“CBT” might be the modal therapy type\n\n“Instagram” might be the most frequent social media platform\n\nFor continuous variables, the mode is less often reported in psychology.\n\n\nComparing mean and median\nThe relationship between mean and median already tells us something about the distribution:\n\nmean ≈ median → distribution is roughly symmetric\n\nmean &gt; median → distribution is right-skewed (few very high scores)\n\nmean &lt; median → distribution is left-skewed (few very low scores)\n\nWhen writing about your data, you can integrate this information:\n\n“The mean and median anxiety scores were very similar (20.1 vs. 20.0), suggesting a roughly symmetric distribution without strong skewness.”\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Variability: how different are people from each other?\nKnowing the centre is important, but in psychology differences between individuals are often just as interesting. Do people cluster tightly around the mean, or are they spread out?\n\nRange – simplest but fragile\nThe range is the difference between the largest and smallest observed value.\nFor anxiety from 6 to 33 points, the range is 27.\nProblem: it depends only on two observations and is extremely sensitive to outliers. One unusual person can change the range completely.\n\n\nInterquartile range (IQR) – spread of the middle 50%\nTo get a more robust measure, we look at the middle 50% of the data:\n\nthe 25th percentile (Q1) – where 25% of scores are below\n\nthe 75th percentile (Q3) – where 75% of scores are below\n\nThe IQR is Q3 − Q1.\nIf Q1 = 16 and Q3 = 23, then IQR = 7.\nThis means that the middle half of students have anxiety between 16 and 23.\nIQR is robust and works well even when a few extreme values exist.\n\n\nStandard deviation (SD) – typical deviation from the mean\nThe standard deviation is the most widely used measure of variability in psychology. Conceptually:\n\nit tells you how far, on average, individual scores are from the mean.\n\nIf the mean anxiety score is 20 and SD is 5, a typical student is about 5 points away from the mean. Many students will fall in the range 15–25.\nA larger SD means more variability:\nstudents differ more strongly from one another.\nIn research reports you often see sentences like:\n\n“Anxiety scores were moderate, M = 20.1, SD = 5.3.”\n\nHere, M is the mean and SD is the standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n7. Putting descriptives into words\nA huge part of statistical skill is the ability to translate numbers into clear, accurate sentences. Consider the following example summary:\n\n“On a 0–40 scale, students reported moderate anxiety\n(M = 20.1, SD = 5.4, Mdn = 20, IQR = 6.5).\nScores ranged from 6 to 33.\nThe similarity of mean and median suggests little skewness.”\n\nThis short paragraph answers four important questions:\n\nLevel: Are scores low, moderate, or high?\n\nVariability: Do students differ a lot in anxiety?\n\nExtremes: What are the lowest and highest scores?\n\nShape: Is the distribution fairly symmetric?\n\nIn your own assignments, aim to write at this level of clarity:\nno unnecessary technical details, but precise enough that another reader can picture the distribution.\n\n\n\n8. Describing and comparing groups\nIn psychological research we often compare groups:\n\ntreatment vs. control\n\nlow vs. high stress\n\nyounger vs. older adults\n\nDescriptive statistics are the first step before any formal test.\nSuppose our two groups have:\n\nLow-stress: mean anxiety 20.5, SD 5.6\n\nHigh-stress: mean anxiety 19.6, SD 5.0\n\nAt first glance, the means are very similar. If we saw this in a table or boxplot, we might write:\n\n“Anxiety levels were similar in the low- and high-stress groups\n(means around 20, SDs around 5), suggesting no strong descriptive group difference.”\n\nThis does not yet answer the inferential question “Are the groups significantly different?” – that comes later with t-tests or ANOVAs. But it already tells us that any difference we find later is unlikely to be dramatic.\nGood practice in psychology:\n\nFirst, describe both groups (means, medians, SDs, IQRs, sample sizes).\n\nThen, and only then, move on to hypothesis tests.\n\n\n\n\n9. Descriptive statistics as the base of everything that follows\nLater in your studies you will encounter many statistical methods:\n\ncorrelations and regression\n\nt-tests and ANOVAs\n\nconfidence intervals and effect sizes\n\nstructural equation models and multilevel models\n\nAll of them rely on the same basic ideas:\n\nwhat is typical in the data,\n\nhow much variability exists,\n\nhow the distribution is shaped,\n\nand how groups or variables relate descriptively.\n\nIf you build a strong intuition for descriptive statistics now, every later method will make much more sense. You will be better able to:\n\nspot unusual or impossible values in a dataset,\n\njudge whether model assumptions are realistic,\n\nread tables and figures in research articles,\n\nand communicate your own findings clearly in reports and theses.\n\nDescriptive statistics are not a boring “first chapter to survive”.\nThey are the core toolkit you will repeatedly use as a psychologist who works with data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulating Example Data\n\nTo make this topic concrete, we simulate data from 120 psychology students completing a 0–40 anxiety scale, together with a stress group (low vs. high). This simulated dataset is used in all visualisations and tables below.\n\n\n\n\nOverview Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean\nSD\nMedian\nIQR\nMin\nMax\n\n\n\n\n20.13333\n5.354545\n20\n6.5\n6\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Comparison Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup\nMean\nSD\nMedian\nIQR\n\n\n\n\nhigh_stress\n19.56250\n5.027187\n19\n7\n\n\nlow_stress\n20.51389\n5.563951\n20\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution Shape (Histogram)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Differences (Boxplot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive statistics give the essential overview needed before deeper analysis:\n\ncentre — where values tend to lie\n\nspread — how much individuals differ\n\nshape — whether data are symmetric or skewed\n\ncomparison — whether groups differ descriptively\n\nThese tools allow students to interpret questionnaire scores, reaction times, clinical scales, and behavioural data with clarity.\n\n\n\nSummary Visual\n\n\n\n\nOverview of descriptive statistics."
