# Welcome

<div class="welcome-box">

Welcome to *Introductory Statistics for Psychology*. This website is designed as a calm, structured companion for your first steps into statistical thinking. It is not a formal university portal or an official institutional page; rather, it is a dedicated learning space created to support you as you move through the core ideas of statistics at your own pace. You can return to it whenever you need an explanation in simpler words, an example to anchor an abstract concept, or a visual summary to make sense of the bigger picture.

Many students begin their studies with mixed feelings about statistics. Some remember struggling with mathematics at school, some have not dealt with numbers for a long time, and others are simply unsure what statistics really means in the context of psychology. It is completely understandable to feel uncertain or even anxious at the beginning. This website explicitly acknowledges those feelings and is built for learners who may not see themselves as especially “mathematical.” You are not expected to understand everything immediately and you are not expected to like statistics from the very first moment. What matters is that you are willing to engage, to be curious, and to give yourself time.

Statistics in psychology is ultimately about making sense of data that come from people. When we measure stress, mood, memory performance, reaction times, social behaviour, or any other psychological construct, we obtain numbers that reflect real experiences and processes. These numbers do not speak for themselves. They need to be organised, summarised, and interpreted carefully. Statistical methods provide the language and tools for doing exactly that. They help us decide whether a pattern we see might be meaningful or whether it is more likely to have arisen by chance in a small sample. They allow us to connect individual observations to broader claims about groups and populations.

The aim of this resource is not to overload you with technical details, but to build a solid and intuitive understanding. New ideas are introduced in plain language first and only then connected to formal notation and calculations. The focus is on answers to questions such as what a concept means, why it is useful, what problem it solves, and how it behaves in simple psychological scenarios. If you move through the materials step by step, you will notice that topics which initially seemed complex start to feel more natural. Confidence in statistics does not appear all at once; it grows gradually as you encounter ideas from multiple angles and see how they connect.

You are invited to use this website actively rather than passively. Read the explanations, pause when something feels unclear, look at the examples, and then revisit earlier sections as needed. Statistics rewards repeated exposure. Each return strengthens connections in your understanding and makes it easier to see how individual pieces fit into a coherent whole. This site exists to support you in that process and to offer a stable point of orientation as you progress.

# What This Course Will Teach You

<div class="section-block">

The content presented here is structured around eight core topics that together form a continuous learning journey. You begin with descriptive statistics, where the essential vocabulary of data analysis is introduced. In this first topic you learn how to distinguish different types of variables, how to summarise what is typical in a dataset, how to quantify differences between individuals, and how to describe the shape of a distribution. You encounter ideas such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, interquartile range, histograms, and boxplots. These ideas may look simple on the surface, yet they are fundamental to everything that follows.

Once you can describe data clearly, you are ready to think about uncertainty. The second topic introduces probability. Here you learn how to reason about events that may or may not occur, how to interpret statements about chances and risks, and how to understand concepts such as independence and conditional probability. Probability provides the conceptual bridge between what we see in a sample and what we want to say about a larger population. It helps you grasp why repeated sampling leads to patterns and why sometimes surprising outcomes can still be expected from a statistical point of view.

Building on this foundation, you move into tests and confidence intervals. In this part you see how statistical methods allow us to make structured claims about unknown quantities. You learn how to formulate hypotheses, how to measure the strength of evidence for or against them, and how to interpret a confidence interval as a range of plausible values rather than as a mystical object. The focus is on understanding what a test does and does not tell you and how conclusions always depend on assumptions and study design.

After learning how to make inferential statements, you turn toward relationships between variables. Covariance and correlation help you describe the degree to which two variables move together. You learn to recognise when a positive association, a negative association, or almost no association appears and how these patterns can inform psychological theories and practical questions. These ideas then open the door to regression, where you begin to model how one variable can be predicted from another.

In simple linear regression, you explore models with a single predictor and see how a straight line can summarise the relationship between two variables. You learn how to interpret the slope and intercept and what it means when a model fits data well or poorly. This naturally extends to partial correlations and multiple regression, where several predictors are considered simultaneously. These topics are particularly important in psychology because many outcomes of interest are influenced by a combination of factors. Understanding how to work with such models helps you think more realistically about complex behaviour and mental processes.

Finally, you encounter analysis of variance, often abbreviated as ANOVA. Here you learn how to compare means across more than two groups in a coherent framework and how to understand variability as something that can be partitioned into meaningful components. This ties back to earlier ideas about variance and standard deviation and shows you how descriptive and inferential concepts interact. By the time you reach this point, you will see that the eight topics are not isolated islands but parts of a connected landscape of ideas.

The intention is that, by moving through all eight topics, you develop not only technical skills but also a deeper sense of how statistics supports psychological research and informed critical thinking. You should come away with an ability to read results, to question them intelligently, and to understand in broad terms what different analyses are doing.

# How to Use This Website

<div class="section-block">

Each topic page on this site is built around three core elements: theory, practice, and summary visuals. These elements are meant to work together and to give you multiple ways of approaching the same underlying ideas. The theory sections provide detailed explanations in continuous text. They aim to be as clear and concrete as possible, using psychological examples and everyday language to explain why a concept matters and how it behaves. When you read these sections, it can be helpful to imagine how the ideas would apply to situations you care about, such as understanding stress, learning, relationships, or mental health.

The practice sections then show you how the concepts appear when you analyse actual data. You will see realistic datasets, R code, and graphical outputs. The goal is not that you memorise every line of code, but that you develop a sense of what typical analyses look like. Over time, patterns will become familiar: you will recognise how data are loaded, how variables are summarised, how distributions are visualised, and how group comparisons are made. You can use these practice sections as guided examples and, if you wish, as starting points to experiment with your own variations.

The summary visuals provide a different kind of access to the material. They condense the main ideas of each topic into carefully designed images that you can revisit quickly. When you are preparing for an exam, working on exercises, or revising a concept you have not seen for a while, these visuals can serve as compact reminders of the structure of the topic. A good learning strategy is to read the theory, work through the practice, and then use the summary visual to check whether you can explain each element of the image in your own words. If something feels vague, you can go back to the relevant section and strengthen that link.

You do not have to move through all topics strictly in a linear fashion. It is often useful to follow the intended order the first time, because later topics assume familiarity with earlier ones. At the same time, you are encouraged to revisit earlier pages whenever a new concept feels difficult. Many ideas in statistics are interconnected. A more solid understanding of descriptive statistics, for example, can make probability and inference easier to grasp. Similarly, a clearer view of variability can make regression models feel less abstract. This website is meant to be a place you move through repeatedly, not a one-time checklist.

If you ever feel stuck, it can help to slow down and focus on a single example rather than the general case. You might take one dataset from the practice section and ask yourself what you would say about it in everyday language before looking at any formulas. Often, translating back and forth between intuitive statements and formal tools is where the deepest learning happens. The materials here are designed to support exactly that type of thinking.

# Begin With Topic 1

<div class="section-block">

If this is your first visit, start with Topic 1 on descriptive statistics. In that topic you will learn how to recognise the different levels of measurement, how to describe what is typical in a dataset, how to quantify spread, and how to talk about the overall shape of a distribution. You will see how even simple summaries such as the mean, median, and standard deviation can tell a rich story about the underlying psychological process that generated the data. You will also see how visualisations like histograms and boxplots can reveal patterns that are not obvious from a table of numbers.

Spending time with these foundations is one of the most valuable investments you can make in your statistical education. Almost every analysis you will encounter later, whether in this resource or in other courses, begins with or should begin with a careful descriptive examination of the data. When you are comfortable interpreting simple summaries and graphs, more complex techniques become far easier to understand. They become natural extensions of ideas you already know rather than entirely new obstacles.

As you move beyond the first topic into probability, inference, correlations, regression, and ANOVA, try to keep a sense of continuity. Each new concept is a response to a question that arises naturally from what came before. Probability answers questions about uncertainty that appear when we look at variable data. Tests and confidence intervals formalise how we decide whether an observed effect might reflect something real. Correlation and regression answer questions about how variables change together. ANOVA responds to the challenge of comparing several groups at once. Seeing the course as a sequence of questions and answers can help keep motivation alive and make the material feel more meaningful.

This website is here to accompany you throughout that journey. You can read it slowly or quickly, alone or alongside lectures and exercises. You can approach it when you feel confident and want to deepen your understanding, and you can also return when you feel unsure and need to rebuild your foundations. Wherever you are starting from, it is possible to grow more comfortable and more skilled with statistics than you might expect.

Welcome to your statistics journey. Let us begin.
