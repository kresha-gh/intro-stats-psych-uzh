# Welcome

<div class="welcome-box">

**Welcome to *Introductory Statistics for Psychology* at the University of Zurich.**  
This website is your interactive companion throughout the first-year statistics course.  
It is designed to guide you step by step through every major topic — from the very first concepts in Descriptive Statistics to the foundations of Correlation, Regression, and ANOVA.

Many students enter university with mixed feelings about mathematics or statistics.  
Some carry difficult experiences from school, others worry about whether they can “handle” numbers.  
If you feel this way, you are not alone — and this course is built precisely with you in mind.

Statistics is not about being a “math person.”  
It is a set of tools that help us understand psychological phenomena — thoughts, emotions, behaviours, well-being, stress, performance — in a structured and meaningful way.  
It allows us to analyse fragments of human experience and reveal patterns that would otherwise remain invisible.

The goal is not to overwhelm you with formulas, but to build genuine understanding.  
With time, practice, and clear explanations, even topics that once felt intimidating become manageable, logical, and sometimes even enjoyable.  
Allow yourself to learn statistics in a new, more intuitive way — step by step, without pressure, and with the confidence that understanding will grow naturally as we proceed.

# What This Course Will Teach You

<div class="section-block">

This course is structured into **eight major topics**, each building on the next:

### **1. Descriptive Statistics**  
How to summarise data: levels of measurement, distributions, measures of centre, variability, and group comparisons. This is the foundation of all statistical thinking.

### **2. Probability**  
How uncertainty works — the rules of probability, independence, and how we quantify the likelihood of events.

### **3. Tests & Confidence Intervals**  
How to draw conclusions from data, compare groups, and estimate unknown parameters responsibly.

### **4. Covariance & Correlation**  
How variables move together — understanding associations and their strengths.

### **5. Simple Linear Regression**  
How one variable can be used to predict another through a simple statistical model.

### **6. Partial Correlations**  
How relationships change when we control for additional variables — essential in psychological research.

### **7. Multiple Regression**  
How several predictors together explain variation in an outcome — the most widely used modelling tool in psychology.

### **8. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**  
How to compare means across multiple groups using variance decomposition.

# How to Use This Website

<div class="section-block">

Each topic page contains three core components:

### **Theory**  
Clear explanations in natural language, building intuition and conceptual understanding.

### **Practice**  
Interactive R-based examples with datasets, visualisations, and worked-through descriptive analysis.

### **Summary Visuals**  
Clean, high-level graphics that condense the most important concepts of the topic into easy-to-review reference images.

Together, these components help you understand statistics not as abstract formulas, but as connected ideas that make sense when explored step by step.

# Begin With Topic 1

<div class="section-block">

If you are visiting for the first time, begin with **Topic 1: Descriptive Statistics**.  
It provides the basic language of quantitative analysis and the essential tools you will use throughout the rest of the course.

As you move through the topics, you will see how theory, practice, and summary visuals reinforce one another — helping you build confidence not only in performing statistical procedures, but in understanding why they work and when they should be used.

Welcome to the journey.  
Let’s get started.
