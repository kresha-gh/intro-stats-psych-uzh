# Introduction: Why We Begin With Descriptive Statistics

Whenever you collect data — questionnaire responses, reaction times, ratings of emotion, stress scores, memory accuracy — the raw numbers rarely speak for themselves. A column of values may contain important information, but without structure it is impossible to know what story the data tell.

Descriptive statistics provide that first layer of structure. They help you understand **what the numbers mean** before you attempt any interpretation or run any formal test. If you think of statistical analysis as building a house, descriptive statistics are the foundation. Without them, the entire building becomes unstable.

When students first enter psychology, they often imagine statistics as formulas or tests. But real statistical thinking begins earlier: with the ability to summarise, describe, and interpret data in everyday language. You learn to look at numbers and see patterns, not noise. This skill is essential — not only for future topics like regression, correlation, or ANOVA, but for scientific reasoning more broadly.

---

# Why Psychologists Depend on Descriptive Statistics

People differ in countless ways: how strongly they react to stress, how quickly they form memories, how empathic they are, how often they worry, how well they sleep. Because psychological characteristics vary so widely, researchers must describe this variation carefully and responsibly.

Descriptive statistics answer questions such as:

- *What is the typical value in the sample?*  
- *How much do individuals differ from each other?*  
- *Are most values clustered together or spread out?*  
- *Are there unusually high or low values?*  
- *Do two groups show meaningful differences before running any test?*  

These are not trivial questions. They determine whether the data you collected make sense, whether they match your expectations, whether your measurement worked properly, and whether it is appropriate to proceed to the next analytical step.

Good researchers always begin with descriptive statistics because this initial understanding ensures responsible interpretation later on. If you skip this step, you risk basing your conclusions on misunderstandings — for example, assuming a group is more anxious when in fact the difference is driven by a single extreme participant.

---

# Understanding Levels of Measurement: The Foundation for Everything Else

Before you summarise a variable, you must understand **what kind of variable it is**. This is not a technical detail — it determines which statistics are meaningful and which would be misleading or even wrong.

Think of it this way: You cannot treat colours, temperature, and reaction times as if they were the same kind of information. Different data types support different operations.

We distinguish four levels of measurement: **nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio**. Below, each is explained in depth, with psychological examples.

---

## Nominal Level  
Nominal variables contain **categories that have no inherent order** — they simply label groups.

Examples include:

- therapy type (CBT, ACT, psychodynamic)  
- coping style categories  
- handedness
- type of emotion being expressed (anger, joy, fear)  
- diagnosis categories  

These categories tell us *which group* someone belongs to, not *how much* of something they have.

### What summaries make sense?  
We can meaningfully compute:

- counts (“How many people responded with each option?”)  
- proportions (“What percentage chose each category?”)

### What is *not* meaningful?  
An **average** would be meaningless because averaging categories implies numerical distance where none exists.

If three participants prefer “CBT,” “ACT,” and “psychodynamic,” the “average” of these three labels has no psychological interpretation. There is no quantity we can interpolate between “CBT” and “ACT.” A category is a name, not a number.

This is why nominal data are never summarised with means, medians, or SDs. They do not represent numerical magnitude.

---

## Ordinal Level  
Ordinal variables represent **ordered categories**, but the spacing between categories is not guaranteed to be equal.

Examples:  

- Likert ratings (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree)  
- symptom severity (“mild,” “moderate,” “severe”)  
- ranking tasks (“1st”, “2nd”, “3rd”)  
- perceived stress levels on a 3-point scale  

These variables tell us *relative order* — who has more or less of something — but they do **not guarantee equal distance** between levels.

A jump from “moderate” to “severe” does not necessarily equal the jump from “mild” to “moderate.” Similarly, the psychological distance between “agree” and “strongly agree” might not match the distance between “neutral” and “agree.”

### What summaries make sense?  

- medians  
- percentiles  
- rank-based statistics  
- ordered bar charts  

### What about means?  
Psychologists often report means for Likert scales, but this is a matter of convention rather than strict mathematics. The mean can be used **if** you interpret it cautiously and understand its limitations.

---

## Interval Level  
Interval variables have:

1. **equal spacing between units**, and  
2. **no true zero**.

A classical example is temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

In some psychological contexts, variables behave *approximately* interval-like, even if not perfectly: for instance, a 0–100 scale measuring subjective well-being, where each point is designed to represent an equal step.

Because spacing is assumed to be equal, we can compute:

- means  
- standard deviations  
- correlations  
- z-scores  

### Why does “no true zero” matter?  
Because without a true zero, ratios become meaningless. For example, 20°C is not “twice as warm” as 10°C — the zero point is arbitrary.

Thus, interval data support many operations, but not ratio statements.

---

## Ratio Level  
Ratio variables are the most informative type. They have:

1. **equal spacing**, and  
2. a **meaningful zero** that represents the total absence of the quantity.

Examples include:  

- reaction time (0 ms means no time elapsed)  
- number of correct answers  
- hours slept  
- anxiety symptoms counted on a 0–40 scale  

Because zero means “none,” ratios become meaningful:

- A reaction time of 600 ms is **twice as long** as 300 ms.  
- A score of 20 symptoms represents **twice the number of symptoms** as a score of 10.

Ratio variables allow all descriptive measures:

- mean  
- median  
- SD  
- IQR  
- correlations  
- ratios  
- comparisons of magnitude  

This is why many psychological measurements aim, when possible, to approximate a ratio scale.

---

# Central Tendency: Describing the “Typical” Score

Every distribution has a central point where most values cluster. Understanding this “centre” helps answer questions like:

- What is a normal level of stress in this group?  
- What is a typical reaction time for this task?  
- What is the usual score on a well-being questionnaire?

We use three main measures: **mean, median, and mode**.

### The Mean  
The mean is what people often call “the average.” It adds all values and divides by the number of observations.

It uses *all* information in the dataset, which makes it powerful — but also vulnerable.

If one individual reports an extremely high stress score, the mean shifts noticeably. This makes the mean **sensitive to outliers**.

### The Median  
The median is the middle value once data are ordered. Half the values lie below it and half above.

It is robust against outliers. If you add one extremely high value, the median remains nearly unchanged.

This often makes the median more informative for skewed psychological variables such as stress, rumination, sadness, or reaction times.

### The Mode  
The mode is the most common value.

Useful when:

- categories are involved,  
- a distribution has multiple peaks,  
- or you want to identify the most frequent response.

---

# Variability: How Much People Differ

Understanding the centre is not enough. Two groups might have the same typical value but differ dramatically in how spread out their scores are.

Variability tells you:

- whether people are similar or diverse,  
- whether a questionnaire captures wide differences,  
- whether groups are consistent or mixed.

### Range  
Max minus min. Simple but heavily distorted by outliers.

### Interquartile Range (IQR)  
Captures the spread of the **middle 50%**. Resistant to extreme scores.

### Standard Deviation (SD)  
Shows the average distance of each value from the mean.

- If SD is small → participants are similar.  
- If SD is large → a lot of diversity.

SD is crucial in psychology because it helps describe how strongly people differ in the very traits we study.

---

# Shape of a Distribution: The Story Behind the Numbers

The centre and variability are just two elements. The *shape* of the distribution completes the picture.

A distribution can be:

- **symmetric**  
- **right-skewed** (a few very high values)  
- **left-skewed** (a few very low values)  
- **bimodal**  
- **flat**  

Each shape reflects a different psychological process.

For example:

- A right-skewed distribution of worry levels suggests that while most individuals worry moderately, a minority worry intensely.  
- A bimodal distribution of reaction times may hint that participants used two different strategies.

Interpreting shapes makes you a better thinker because you learn to see patterns rather than focusing solely on numbers.

---

# Comparing Groups Descriptively

Much of psychology involves comparing groups: people in different conditions, treatments, environments, or roles.

Descriptive comparisons help you see:

- whether one group tends to score higher or lower,  
- whether variability differs,  
- whether one group shows more extreme or unusual values,  
- and whether group differences look meaningful even before testing.

These descriptive insights guide hypotheses, interpretation, and responsible scientific reasoning.

---

# Why All of This Matters for Your Future in Statistics

Descriptive statistics may seem simple at first glance, but they are deeply foundational. Every later topic — probability, confidence intervals, regression, ANOVA, correlation — relies on concepts introduced here.

If you understand:

- types of variables,  
- measures of centre,  
- measures of variability,  
- distribution shapes,  
- group differences,

then the rest of statistics becomes far less intimidating.

Descriptive statistics teach you how to **read data**, not just compute numbers.  
They train the interpretative skills that every psychologist needs — from designing better studies to understanding your own findings.

## Practice

<div class="reveal">

### Simulated Study: Exam Anxiety in First-Year Students

To connect theory with practical application, we will work with one realistic, simulated dataset. Imagine a study where **160 first-year university students** complete a short questionnaire one week before an important exam.

For each student we record:

- **id** – anonymous participant number  
- **group** – whether the student reports *low* or *high* stress about the upcoming exam (nominal)  
- **gender** – three self-reported categories (nominal)  
- **exam_anxiety** – a 0–40 score measuring exam-related anxiety (ratio)  
- **sleep_hours** – average nightly sleep during the week before the exam (ratio)  
- **satisfaction** – a 1–5 rating of satisfaction with their study situation (ordinal)

The following code simulates this dataset exactly once and prepares all tables and graphs used in this section.

```{r}

    select(-satisfaction_latent)

# Descriptives

    summarise(
        n = n(),
        mean = mean(exam_anxiety),
        median = median(exam_anxiety),
        sd = sd(exam_anxiety),
        IQR = IQR(exam_anxiety),
        min = min(exam_anxiety),
        max = max(exam_anxiety)
    )

    group_by(group) |>
    summarise(

### Getting to Know the Dataset

Below is the full dataset in an interactive table.
You can scroll, sort, and search entries.

```{r}
datatable(
    dat,
    options = list(pageLength = 10),
    rownames = FALSE
)
```

This first step helps you check:

* values look realistic
* sleep hours and anxiety fall in expected ranges
* gender and stress groups are split as expected
* the dataset contains no obvious errors before summarizing

---

### Nominal Variables: Group and Gender

Nominal variables describe categories, not quantities.
We summarise them using frequencies and percentages.

```{r}
tab_group |>
    mutate(prop = paste0(prop, " %")) |>
    kable(
        caption = "Distribution of Students Across Stress Groups",
        align = c("l", "r", "r")
    )
```

```{r}
tab_gender |>
    mutate(prop = paste0(prop, " %")) |>
    kable(
        caption = "Distribution of Students Across Gender Categories",
        align = c("l", "r", "r")
    )
```

---

### Ordinal Variable: Satisfaction

Satisfaction is an ordered 1–5 rating. We describe ordinal variables with frequencies, because the spacing between categories is not assumed equal.

```{r}
tab_satisfaction |>
    mutate(prop = paste0(prop, " %")) |>
    kable(
        caption = "Satisfaction Ratings (1 = dissatisfied, 5 = very satisfied)",
        align = c("c", "r", "r")
    )
```

---

### Exam Anxiety: Describing Center and Spread

Now we summarise the main continuous variable.

```{r}
overall_exam |>
    kable(
        caption = "Overall Descriptive Statistics for Exam Anxiety",
        digits = 2,
        col.names = c("n", "Mean", "Median", "SD", "IQR", "Min", "Max")
    )
```

You can think of:

* **mean / median** → what is typical
* **SD / IQR** → how much students differ
* **min / max** → full extent of variation

---

### Anxiety by Stress Group

Group comparisons help you see whether descriptive differences appear before formal tests.

```{r}
exam_by_group |>
    kable(
        caption = "Exam Anxiety by Stress Group",
        digits = 2,
        col.names = c("Group", "n", "Mean", "Median", "SD", "IQR")
    )
```

---

### Histogram of Exam Anxiety

```{r}
ggplotly(p_hist_exam)
```



**Interpretation of the Histogram: Understanding the Distribution of Exam Anxiety**

The histogram gives us the first in-depth look at how exam anxiety is distributed across all 160 students. The overall shape is roughly bell-shaped, meaning most students cluster around a moderate anxiety level. The tallest bars fall between 18 and 24 points, indicating that this range represents the most common anxiety scores in the sample. Very few students score extremely low (close to 0–10) or extremely high (above 30), which suggests that extreme anxiety responses are relatively rare in this cohort.

The distribution appears fairly symmetric, with no strong skew toward low or high values. That tells us that the mean and median should be relatively close to one another and reflect the “typical” student quite well. The slight tapering at both ends indicates that while variation exists, it is centered around a clear middle region rather than spread evenly across all possible values.

From a psychological perspective, this shape makes intuitive sense. Most students experience some level of exam anxiety, but only a small subset are completely calm or strongly overwhelmed. The histogram therefore provides a meaningful first insight: the majority of students fall into a moderate-anxiety zone, with only a handful showing exceptionally low or high levels.

### Boxplot: Between-Group Comparison

```{r}
ggplotly(p_box_exam)
```



**Interpretation of the Boxplot: Anxiety Differences Between Stress Groups**

The boxplot visually compares exam anxiety between the Low stress and High stress groups, and the pattern is immediately clear. Students who rated themselves as High stress show substantially higher exam anxiety on average. This is reflected in the position of the median: the horizontal line inside the green box is noticeably higher than the one inside the red box. In other words, the “typical” high-stress student is more anxious than the “typical” low-stress student.

The spread (height of each box) also tells an important story. The High stress group has a somewhat larger interquartile range (IQR), meaning that their anxiety levels are not only higher on average but also more variable. Students in this group differ from each other more strongly – some report moderately elevated anxiety, others report very high anxiety levels.

The whiskers and occasional outliers show that both groups include individuals whose scores fall outside the central range, but the high-stress group tends to show higher extreme values. The low-stress group, by contrast, has a lower median, a narrower box, and a lower upper whisker, suggesting that students in this group are both less anxious and more consistent in their responses.

Altogether, the boxplot offers a strong descriptive indication that the subjective stress grouping meaningfully corresponds to actual exam anxiety levels. Before running any statistical tests, this visualisation already reveals a clear and psychologically plausible relationship: students who feel stressed about the exam tend to be more anxious when measured objectively.

### Summary of Practice Concepts

In this Practice section, you have seen:

* how to explore **nominal** variables via counts
* how to summarise **ordinal** variables via frequency tables
* how to describe **ratio** variables using means, medians, SDs, and IQRs
* how to use **histograms** for distribution shape
* how to use **boxplots** for comparing groups

These tools form the foundation for everything that follows in probability, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, correlation, and regression.

## Summary

<div class="card-block reveal">

Descriptive statistics form the foundation of all quantitative reasoning in psychology. Before any hypothesis can be tested or any model can be built, we must first understand what our data look like. This begins with recognising the different levels of measurement and how they determine what kinds of statistics are meaningful. Nominal variables such as gender or stress group are categorical and can only be summarised using counts and percentages; computing averages for them would be conceptually meaningless because the categories have no inherent numerical distance. Ordinal variables, like satisfaction ratings, preserve an order but not equal spacing, which is why medians and frequency distributions are preferred over means. For interval and ratio variables—such as exam anxiety or hours of sleep—we can meaningfully compute means, standard deviations, and other quantitative summaries, because the underlying scale reflects consistent numerical differences.

With measurement foundations in place, descriptive statistics help us capture the essential characteristics of a dataset. Measures of central tendency (mean, median) indicate where most observations tend to lie; measures of variability (IQR, standard deviation) show how widely individuals differ from one another. These numerical summaries are complemented by visual tools: histograms reveal the overall shape of a distribution, including whether scores are symmetric, skewed, unimodal, or spread unevenly; boxplots illustrate the median, quartiles, and possible outliers, and offer a straightforward way to compare groups side by side. When we combine these numerical and graphical summaries, we gain a far more complete understanding of our data than any single measure could provide.

In the practical example, we saw how these concepts come together in a real dataset. Exam anxiety scores exhibited a roughly bell-shaped distribution, illustrating how most students fall into a moderate range of anxiety while only a few show extremely high or low values. Nominal variables such as self-reported stress group and gender were appropriately summarised using frequencies and percentages. Ordinal satisfaction ratings revealed how students’ general study experience varies, without assuming equal spacing between response options. Comparing anxiety levels between low- and high-stress groups demonstrated how descriptive statistics reveal meaningful group differences even before formal statistical tests are applied. Higher medians and a wider spread in the high-stress group illustrated both elevated anxiety and greater variability among those students.

Taken together, the descriptive tools presented in this chapter help students build an intuitive and technically correct understanding of psychological data. They teach us how to accurately summarise what we have observed, how to distinguish between different types of variables, how to describe distributions clearly, and how to identify patterns that might inspire further analysis. By mastering descriptive statistics, students lay the groundwork for all subsequent topics in the course—from probability to confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression, and beyond. Descriptive statistics are not merely introductory; they are the essential first step in every scientific investigation, and they shape the clarity and validity of all conclusions drawn from psychological research.
