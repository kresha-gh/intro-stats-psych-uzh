## Theory

<div class="reveal">

### 1. Why psychologists need descriptive statistics

Imagine you run your very first study:  
120 students fill in an anxiety questionnaire before an important exam.  
You download the data, open the file – and suddenly you are staring at a long
list of numbers.

On its own, this list does not tell you much. You cannot immediately see

- how anxious the *average* student feels,  
- whether there are big differences between students,  
- whether anxiety is mostly low with a few very anxious students,  
- or whether students in a “high-stress” group are actually more anxious.

Descriptive statistics are the tools that turn this raw list of numbers into a
clear picture. They help you **summarise**, **organise**, and **describe** the
data so you can understand what is going on in your sample.

Before we talk about hypotheses, p-values, or effect sizes, we always start
here: with a careful descriptive look at the data. If the descriptive picture
is wrong or unclear, all later conclusions become shaky.

You can think of descriptive statistics as the **“language” your data speaks**.
Learning this language is one of the core skills of a psychologist who works
with empirical findings.

### 2. From individual cases to an overview

Psychological data almost always come from many individuals:  
students, patients, couples, families, therapy groups.

For example:

- 120 students’ anxiety scores (0–40)  
- 80 patients’ depression scores before and after therapy  
- 200 people’s hours of sleep per night  
- 60 participants’ reaction times in a decision task  

Looking at each person one by one is impossible. Instead, we ask questions at
the *group level*:

- What is a **typical** anxiety score in this group?  
- How much do scores **vary** between people?  
- Are extreme values present – e.g., extremely high depression scores?  
- How does one group (e.g., low vs. high stress) **compare** to another?

Descriptive statistics provide answers by compressing many numbers into a few
meaningful summaries.

---

### 3. Variables and levels of measurement

Before summarising anything, we must understand **what kind of variable** we are
dealing with. Different variables allow different kinds of questions and
statistics.

#### Nominal variables – categories without order

Nominal variables place people into categories with **no natural ranking**.

Examples in psychology:

- handedness: left / right  
- therapy type: CBT / ACT / psychodynamic / none  
- favourite social media platform  

For nominal variables we can meaningfully talk about:

- **how many** people are in each category  
- **which** category is most common  

We cannot meaningfully compute a mean or a median of “therapy types”.

#### Ordinal variables – ordered categories

Ordinal variables have categories that can be ordered, but we do not know how
big the steps between categories are.

Examples:

- symptom severity: “none, mild, moderate, severe”  
- agreement with a statement: 1 = “strongly disagree” to 5 = “strongly agree”  
- satisfaction with therapy: “not at all” to “very much”

Here we can say:

- A score of 4 means **more** of something than a score of 2.  
- But we do not know if the difference between 1 and 2 is the same size as the
  difference between 4 and 5.

For ordinal data, medians and percentiles are often more appropriate than means,
because they respect the order without assuming equal distances.

#### Interval variables – equal steps, no true zero

Interval variables have equal units, but zero does **not** mean “nothing”.

The classic example is temperature in °C:  
The difference between 10°C and 20°C is the same as between 20°C and 30°C, but
0°C does not mean “no temperature”.

In psychology we rarely have pure interval variables, but many scales are *treated*
as if they were at least approximately interval. This is one reason why we often
compute means and standard deviations for questionnaire scores.

#### Ratio variables – equal steps and a meaningful zero

For ratio variables, zero truly means “none of the quantity”.

Examples:

- reaction time in milliseconds (0 ms = no time)  
- number of mistakes in a memory test (0 errors = perfect performance)  
- hours of sleep per night (0 hours = did not sleep)  
- anxiety scores from 0 to 40, where 0 means no reported anxiety symptoms

Most continuous psychological variables are at least approximately ratio. For
ratio variables we can use all the familiar tools: means, SDs, ratios (“twice
as fast”), correlations, and so on.

---

### 4. Describing distributions: not just one number

Each variable in your dataset has a **distribution**: it shows how often
different values occur.

For example, if you plot the frequency of anxiety scores from 0 to 40, you
might see:

- many students around 18–22 points,  
- fewer students with very low or very high anxiety,  
- perhaps a single very anxious student around 35.

This shape matters. Two variables can have the same mean but very different
distributions. Knowing the distribution helps you decide:

- which summary statistics are appropriate,  
- whether the data meet assumptions for later methods,  
- whether a few extreme values are driving the results.

In descriptive statistics, we often describe distributions in words:

> “Anxiety scores were roughly symmetric and centred around 20, with most
> students scoring between 15 and 25. Only a few students reported very low or
> very high anxiety.”

Being able to write such sentences clearly is a core skill for psychological
reporting.

---

### 5. Central tendency: describing the “typical” value

We now turn to measures of **central tendency** — numbers that describe where
the centre of a distribution lies.

#### Mean – the arithmetic average

The mean is what many people call the “average”:  
add all scores and divide by the number of scores.

In our anxiety example, a mean of 20 would mean that, on average, students
reported moderate anxiety.

Strengths:

- uses all information in the data  
- widely used in research articles and statistics

Weakness:

- very sensitive to **outliers**.  
  If one student has a score of 40, the mean moves upwards, even if everyone
  else has moderate anxiety.

Because of this sensitivity, the mean works best for distributions that are
not extremely skewed and do not contain extreme outliers.

#### Median – the middle observation

The median is the value that splits the distribution in half:  
50% of scores are below, 50% are above.

If the median anxiety score is 19, half of the students have anxiety 19 or
lower, and half have 19 or higher.

Strengths:

- robust to extreme values (one very anxious student does not change the median
  much)  
- works well for skewed or ordinal data

Weakness:

- less sensitive to subtle changes in the whole distribution

#### Mode – the most frequent value

The mode is the value that occurs most often.

This is especially useful for **categorical** variables:

- “CBT” might be the modal therapy type  
- “Instagram” might be the most frequent social media platform

For continuous variables, the mode is less often reported in psychology.

#### Comparing mean and median

The relationship between mean and median already tells us something about the
distribution:

- mean ≈ median → distribution is roughly symmetric  
- mean > median → distribution is right-skewed (few very high scores)  
- mean < median → distribution is left-skewed (few very low scores)

When writing about your data, you can integrate this information:

> “The mean and median anxiety scores were very similar (20.1 vs. 20.0),
> suggesting a roughly symmetric distribution without strong skewness.”

---

### 6. Variability: how different are people from each other?

Knowing the centre is important, but in psychology **differences between
individuals** are often just as interesting. Do people cluster tightly around
the mean, or are they spread out?

#### Range – simplest but fragile

The range is the difference between the largest and smallest observed value.

For anxiety from 6 to 33 points, the range is 27.

Problem: it depends only on two observations and is extremely sensitive to
outliers. One unusual person can change the range completely.

#### Interquartile range (IQR) – spread of the middle 50%

To get a more robust measure, we look at the middle 50% of the data:

- the 25th percentile (Q1) – where 25% of scores are below  
- the 75th percentile (Q3) – where 75% of scores are below  

The IQR is Q3 − Q1.

If Q1 = 16 and Q3 = 23, then IQR = 7.  
This means that the middle half of students have anxiety between 16 and 23.

IQR is robust and works well even when a few extreme values exist.

#### Standard deviation (SD) – typical deviation from the mean

The standard deviation is the most widely used measure of variability in
psychology. Conceptually:

- it tells you how far, on average, individual scores are from the mean.  

If the mean anxiety score is 20 and SD is 5, a typical student is about 5 points
away from the mean. Many students will fall in the range 15–25.

A larger SD means more variability:  
students differ more strongly from one another.

In research reports you often see sentences like:

> “Anxiety scores were moderate, *M* = 20.1, *SD* = 5.3.”

Here, *M* is the mean and *SD* is the standard deviation.

---

### 7. Putting descriptives into words

A huge part of statistical skill is the ability to translate numbers into clear,
accurate sentences. Consider the following example summary:

> “On a 0–40 scale, students reported moderate anxiety  
> (*M* = 20.1, *SD* = 5.4, *Mdn* = 20, IQR = 6.5).  
> Scores ranged from 6 to 33.  
> The similarity of mean and median suggests little skewness.”

This short paragraph answers four important questions:

1. **Level**: Are scores low, moderate, or high?  
2. **Variability**: Do students differ a lot in anxiety?  
3. **Extremes**: What are the lowest and highest scores?  
4. **Shape**: Is the distribution fairly symmetric?

In your own assignments, aim to write at this level of clarity:  
no unnecessary technical details, but precise enough that another reader can
picture the distribution.

---

### 8. Describing and comparing groups

In psychological research we often compare groups:

- treatment vs. control  
- low vs. high stress  
- younger vs. older adults  

Descriptive statistics are the first step before any formal test.

Suppose our two groups have:

- Low-stress: mean anxiety 20.5, SD 5.6  
- High-stress: mean anxiety 19.6, SD 5.0  

At first glance, the means are very similar. If we saw this in a table or
boxplot, we might write:

> “Anxiety levels were similar in the low- and high-stress groups  
> (means around 20, SDs around 5), suggesting no strong descriptive group
> difference.”

This does **not** yet answer the inferential question “Are the groups
significantly different?” – that comes later with t-tests or ANOVAs. But it
already tells us that any difference we find later is unlikely to be dramatic.

Good practice in psychology:

1. First, **describe** both groups (means, medians, SDs, IQRs, sample sizes).  
2. Then, and only then, move on to hypothesis tests.  

---

### 9. Descriptive statistics as the base of everything that follows

Later in your studies you will encounter many statistical methods:

- correlations and regression  
- t-tests and ANOVAs  
- confidence intervals and effect sizes  
- structural equation models and multilevel models  

All of them rely on the same basic ideas:

- what is typical in the data,  
- how much variability exists,  
- how the distribution is shaped,  
- and how groups or variables relate descriptively.

If you build a strong intuition for descriptive statistics now, every later
method will make much more sense. You will be better able to:

- spot unusual or impossible values in a dataset,  
- judge whether model assumptions are realistic,  
- read tables and figures in research articles,  
- and communicate your own findings clearly in reports and theses.

Descriptive statistics are not a boring “first chapter to survive”.  
They are the **core toolkit** you will repeatedly use as a psychologist who
works with data.

### Simulating Example Data  
<div class="card-block reveal">

To make this topic concrete, we simulate data from **120 psychology students**
completing a **0–40 anxiety scale**, together with a **stress group** (low vs.
high). This simulated dataset is used in all visualisations and tables below.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(gt)
library(tibble)

if (!dir.exists("data")) dir.create("data")
file_path <- "data/topic1_descriptive.csv"

if (!file.exists(file_path)) {
    set.seed(123)
    dat <- tibble(
        id = 1:120,
        anxiety_score = round(rnorm(120, mean = 20, sd = 6)),
        group = sample(c("Low stress", "High stress"), 120, replace = TRUE)
    ) |> mutate(anxiety_score = pmin(pmax(anxiety_score, 0), 40))
    write.csv(dat, file_path, row.names = FALSE)
}
dat <- read.csv(file_path)

overall <- dat |>
    summarise(
        Mean = mean(anxiety_score),
        SD = sd(anxiety_score),
        Median = median(anxiety_score),
        IQR = IQR(anxiety_score),
        Min = min(anxiety_score),
        Max = max(anxiety_score)
    ) |>
    gt()

by_group <- dat |>
    group_by(group) |>
    summarise(
        Mean = mean(anxiety_score),
        SD = sd(anxiety_score),
        Median = median(anxiety_score),
        IQR = IQR(anxiety_score)
    ) |>
    gt()

hist_plot <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = anxiety_score)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 12, fill = "#FF9F1C", color = "white") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
    labs(x = "Anxiety score", y = "Count")

box_plot <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = group, y = anxiety_score, fill = group)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("#2EC4B6", "#E71D36")) +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
    labs(x = "", y = "Anxiety score")

## Summary

<div class="card-block reveal">

Descriptive statistics give the essential overview needed before deeper
analysis:

- **centre** — where values tend to lie  
- **spread** — how much individuals differ  
- **shape** — whether data are symmetric or skewed  
- **comparison** — whether groups differ descriptively  

These tools allow students to interpret questionnaire scores, reaction times,
clinical scales, and behavioural data with clarity.
